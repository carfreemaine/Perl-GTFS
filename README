Perl-GTFS

A set of perl modules for dealing with GTFS data

See Google's GTFS spec for the details on what a GTFS Feed looks like

USAGE:

Create a database handle $dbh with one of the DBI modules.

For example, using CSV, with the files stored in $mydir:

use DBI;
$dbh = DBI->connect("DBI:CSV:f_dir=$mydir;f_ext=.txt;csv_sep_char=,;csv_quote_char=\"") or die;
$gtfs_data = GTFS->new($dbh,[$options]);


or using a mySQL database:

use DBI;
$dbh = DBI->connect("DBI:mysql:database=$database",$username,$password) or die;
$gtfs_data = GTFS->new($dbh,[$options]);


You can use other DBI connection handles, I've tested CSV and MySQL, which is what I'll use for testing.

$gtfs_data is a reference to a hash with the following key->value pairs:

$->{database} is the stored reference to the database handle $dbh
$->{options} is a currently unsupported hashref that does nothing at this time
$->{routes} is a reference to a hash of Route objects (see Route.pm), keyed on the route_id attribute
$->{trips} is a similar has for Trip objects (Trip.pm) keyed on trip_id
$->{stops} is the same with Stop.pm and stop_id


TO DO:
write similar methods for writing each object type to a database handle
extend the methods for Route and Trip to fill in the array of trips and stops, respectively
write a GTFS method for initializing the Pattern objects and storing them in the database
write methods to find average speed, travel time and stops per mile for each Trip or Pattern object
write a KML output module
